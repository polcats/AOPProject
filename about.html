				<h3>About Us</h3>
				<p>We are undergraduate students of Saint Louis University who are taking up Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. It is our intention to extend our capabilities and use these to contribute to our community, and one way to achieve this is by pursuing a valuable goal.</p>

				<p>Pursuing our goal won't be very easy, we expect it to be challenging. Given those, we seek our visitors to help us even in the simplest ways &mdash; by helping us spread the importance of peace and order. We are going to be very thankful to whoever lends us a hand.</p>
